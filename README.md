Morphing the WP Underscores Template into Something Wonderful
Not sure why I didn't start coding in earnest, years ago, as the desire was always there. I've dabbled a bit in C, a long time ago when it was a requirement to start, run and maintain my MajorBBS, Galacticomm software for my company, Amusers, Inc. I say requirement because when Tim Stryker at Galacticomm sent me my software there was no .exe file!!!  He kindly explained that he had sent me the source code and that I would need to invest in a compiler to make my very own .exe file.  How fun, how daunting, how terrifying!  Too bad my multi-user BBS, one of the first of its kind, attracted many code adepts who were more than happy to take over the code wrangling required to keep the site bug free and fresh to the users.
